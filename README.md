![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp/master/Overview.jpg)

Seq2SeqSharp provides the unified tensor operations, which means all tensor operations running on CPUs and GPUs are completely same and they can get switched on different device types without any modification.  
Seq2SeqSharp is also a framework that neural networks can run on multi-GPUs in parallel. It can automatically distribute/sync weights/gradients over devices, manage resources and models and so on, so developers are able to totally focus on how to design and implment networks for their tasks.  
Seq2SeqSharp is built by (.NET core)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/], so it can run on both Windows and Linux without any modification and recompilation.  

# Usage  
Seq2SeqSharp provides some command line tools that you can run for different types of tasks.

### Data Format for Seq2SeqConsole tool  
The training/valid corpus contain each sentence per line. The file name pattern is "mainfilename.{source language name}.snt" and "mainfilename.{target language name}.snt".    
For example: Let's use three letters name CHS for Chinese and ENU for English in Chinese-English parallel corpus, so we could have these corpus files: train01.enu.snt, train01.chs.snt, train02.enu.snt and train02.chs.snt.  
In train01.enu.snt, assume we have below two sentences:  
the children huddled together for warmth .  
the car business is constantly changing .  
So, train01.chs.snt has the corresponding translated sentences:  
孩子 们 挤 成 一 团 以 取暖 .  
汽车 业 也 在 不断 地 变化 .  

To apply contextual features, you can append features to the line of input text and split them by tab character.  
Here is an example. Let's assume we have a translation model that can translate English to Chinese, Japanese and Korean, so given a English sentence, we need to apply a contextual feature to let the model know which language it should translate to.  
In train01.enu.snt, the input will be changed to:  
the children huddled together for warmth . \t CHS  
the car business is constantly changing . \t CHS  
But train01.cjk.snt is the same as train01.chs.snt in above.  
孩子 们 挤 成 一 团 以 取暖 .  
汽车 业 也 在 不断 地 变化 .  

## SeqClassification for sequence-classification task  
SeqClassification is used to classify input sequence to a certain category.  Given an input sequence, the tool will add a [CLS] tag at the beginning of sequence, and then send it to the encoder. At top layer of the encoder, it will run softmax against [CLS] and decide which category the sequence belongs to.  
This tool can be used to train a model for sequence-classification task, and test the model.  

Here is the graph that what the model looks like:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp/master/SeqClassificationModel.jpeg)

Here is the configuration file for model training.  
```json
{
    "Task":"Train",
    "EmbeddingDim":512,
    "HiddenSize":512,
    "StartLearningRate":0.0006,

    "TrainCorpusPath":".\\data\\transcripts_cls_train.snt",
    "ValidCorpusPath":".\\data\\transcripts_cls_valid.snt",
    "InputTestFile":null,

    "VocabSize":45000,
    "ShuffleType": "NoPaddingInSrc",
    "CompilerOptions":"--use_fast_math --gpu-architecture=compute_60"
}
```

### Data format for SeqCliassificationConsole tool  
It also uses two files for each pair of data and follows the same naming convention as Seq2SeqConsole tool in above. The source file includes tokens as input to the model, and the target file includes the corresponding tags that model will predict. Each line contains one record.  
The model supports multi-classifiers, so tags in the target file are split by tab character, such as [Tag1] \t [Tag2] \t ... \t [TagN]. Each classifiers predicts one tag.  

Here is an example:  
| Tag                  |  Tokens in Sequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |   
| Otorhinolaryngology  | What should I do if I have a sore throat and a runny nose? [SEP] I feel sore in my throat after getting up in the morning, and I still have clear water in my nose. I measure my body temperature and I don’t have a fever. Have you caught a cold? What medicine should be taken.                                                                             |
| Orthopedics          | How can I recuperate if my ankle is twisted? [SEP] I twisted my ankle when I went down the stairs, and now it is red and swollen. X-rays were taken and there were no fractures. May I ask how to recuperate to get better as soon as possible.                                                                                                                |

"Otorhinolaryngology" and "Orthopedics" are tags for classification and the rest of the tokens in each line are tokens for input sequence. This is an example that given title and description in medical domain, asking model to predict which specialty it should be classified. [SEP] is used to split title and description in the sequence, but it's not required in other tasks.  

## Seq2SeqClassificationConsole for sequence-to-sequence and classification multi-tasks  
Here is the graph that what the model looks like:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp/master/Seq2SeqClassificationModel.jpeg)


## SeqLabelConsole for sequence-labeling task  
The usage of **SeqLabelConsole.exe** is similar as **Seq2SeqConsole.exe** in above, you can just type it in the console and it will show you usage.  

### Data format for SeqLabelConsole tool  
The data format is one token along with the corresponding tag per line. Tokens are inputs for model training, and tags are what the model trys to predict during the training.  
Token and tags are split by tab character. It looks like [Token] \t [Tag] And each sentence is split by a blank line. This format is compatible with the data for CRFSharp and CRF++.  
Here is an example:  
In train_001.txt, assume we have two sentences. For sentence "Microsoft is located in Redmond .", "Microsoft" is organization name, "Redmond" is location name. For sentence "Zhongkai Fu is the author of Seq2SeqSharp .", "Zhongkai Fu" is person name and "Seq2SeqSharp" is software name. So, the training corpus should look likes:  
| Token        |   Tag   |
| ------------ | ------- |  
| Microsoft    | S_ORG   |
| is           | S_NOR   |
| located      | S_NOR   |
| in           | S_NOR   |
| Redmond      | S_LOC   |
| .            | S_NOR   |
| [BLANK]      | [BLANK] |
| Zhongkai     | B_PER   |
| Fu           | E_PER   |
| is           | S_NOR   |
| the          | S_NOR   |
| author       | S_NOR   |
| of           | S_NOR   |
| Seq2SeqSharp | S_SFT   |
| .            | S_NOR   |

All sentences were already encoded to subwords by SentencePiece, so the package also includes the model and vocabulary of SentencePiece.  

(SentencePiece)[https://github.com/google/sentencepiece] is a subword level tokenization tool from Google. Given raw text, it can build model and vocabulary at subword level, encode text from word level to subword level or decode subword text back to word level. Subword level tokenization could significantly reduce vocabulary size which is useful for OOV and decoding performance improvement for many systems, especially low resource systems. Subword level tokenization and SentencePiece are optional for Seq2SeqSharp. You can tokenize input text to any type of tokens and send them to Seq2SeqSharp or let Seq2SeqSharp generate them.  

The model in the release package was trained by training corpus processed by SentencePiece, so inputs and outputs text of this model needs to be pre-processed by SentencePiece. Again, you could train your model with/without SentencePiece. It's totally optional.  

Here are steps on how to play it.  

0. Preparation  

   0.1 Install Nvidia driver and Cuda 11.4  

      Windows: Download (Nvidia driver)[https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx] and (Cuda 11.4)[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.1.0-download-archive], and then install them.  

      Linux: You can use apt to update drivers and cuda, for example: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470  

   0.2 Install dotNet core  

      Windows: Download (.NET Core)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/] and install.  

      Linux: You can use the following apt-get commands to download and install it:  

         sudo apt-get update  

         sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https  

         sudo apt-get update  

         sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0  


   0.3 Install SentencePiece (optional)  

      You can follow instructions on (SentencePiece github)[https://github.com/google/sentencepiece] to download and install it. It supports both Windows and Linux.  


1. Run SentencePiece to encode raw input English text to subword (optional)  

   You can run the following example command for encoding: spm_encode --model=enuSpm.model test_raw.txt > test_spm.txt  

   The test input files in the release package are already encoded, so you do not have to do it.   



2. Run Seq2SeqSharp to translate the above input text from English to Chinese  

   You can run the following command for translation.  

      Seq2SeqConsole.exe -TaskName Test -ModelFilePath seq2seq_mt.model -InputTestFile test_spm.txt -OutputTestFile out.txt -MaxSrcSentLength 100 -MaxTgtSentLength 100 -ProcessorType CPU  


3. Run SentencePiece to decode output Chinese text (optional)  

   You can run the following command for decoding: spm_decode --model=chsSpm.model out.txt > out_raw.txt    


4. Check quality by comparing output Chinese text with reference text

# Build From Source Code  
Besides using the release package, you could also build Seq2SeqSharp from source code. It has just two steps:  

1. Clone the project from github: git clone https://github.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp.git  
2. Build all projects: dotnet build Seq2SeqSharp.sln --configuration Release  

# Using different CUDA versions and .NET versions  
Seq2SeqSharp uses CUDA 11.x and .NET 6.0 by default, but you can still use different versions of them. It has already been tested on .NET core 3.1, CUDA 10.x and some other versions.  

For different CUDA versions, you need to change the versions of ManagedCUDA to the corresponding versions. They are all in *.project files. For example: The following settings are in TensorSharp.CUDA.project for CUDA 10.2  
```xml
    <PackageReference Include="ManagedCuda-102">  
      <Version>10.2.41</Version>  
    </PackageReference>  
    <PackageReference Include="ManagedCuda-CUBLAS">  
      <Version>10.2.41</Version>  
    </PackageReference>  
    <PackageReference Include="ManagedCuda-NVRTC">  
      <Version>10.2.41</Version>  
    </PackageReference>  
```

For different .NET versions, you need to modify target framework in *.csproj files. Here is an example to use .net core 3.1 as target framework in Seq2SeqSharp.csproj file.  
```xml
    <PropertyGroup>  
      <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>  
    </PropertyGroup>  
```

# Built-in Tags  
Seq2SeqSharp has several built-in tokens and they are used for certain purposes.  
| Token   | Comments                                                  |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| \</s\>  | The end of the sequence                                   |
| \<s\>   | The beginning of the sequence                             |
| \<unk\> | OOV token                                                 |
| [SEP]   | The token used to split input sequence into many segments |
| [CLS]   | The token used to predict classification                  |


# Build Your Layers  
Benefit from automatic differentiation, tensor based compute graph and other features, you can easily build your customized layers by a few code. The only thing you need to implment is forward part, and the framework will automatically build the corresponding backward part for you, and make the network could run on multi-GPUs or CPUs.  
Here is an example about **attentioned based LSTM cells**.  
```c#
        /// <summary>
        /// Update LSTM-Attention cells according to given weights
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="context">The context weights for attention</param>
        /// <param name="input">The input weights</param>
        /// <param name="computeGraph">The compute graph to build workflow</param>
        /// <returns>Update hidden weights</returns>
        public IWeightTensor Step(IWeightTensor context, IWeightTensor input, IComputeGraph g)
        {
            var computeGraph = g.CreateSubGraph(m_name);

            var cell_prev = Cell;
            var hidden_prev = Hidden;

            var hxhc = computeGraph.ConcatColumns(input, hidden_prev, context);
            var hhSum = computeGraph.Affine(hxhc, m_Wxhc, m_b);
            var hhSum2 = layerNorm1.Process(hhSum, computeGraph);

            (var gates_raw, var cell_write_raw) = computeGraph.SplitColumns(hhSum2, m_hdim * 3, m_hdim);
            var gates = computeGraph.Sigmoid(gates_raw);
            var cell_write = computeGraph.Tanh(cell_write_raw);

            (var input_gate, var forget_gate, var output_gate) = computeGraph.SplitColumns(gates, m_hdim, m_hdim, m_hdim);

            // compute new cell activation: ct = forget_gate * cell_prev + input_gate * cell_write
            Cell = computeGraph.EltMulMulAdd(forget_gate, cell_prev, input_gate, cell_write);
            var ct2 = layerNorm2.Process(Cell, computeGraph);

            Hidden = computeGraph.EltMul(output_gate, computeGraph.Tanh(ct2));

            return Hidden;
        }
```
Another example about **scaled multi-heads attention** component which is the core part in **Transformer** model.  
```c#
        /// <summary>
        /// Scaled multi-heads attention component with skip connectioned feed forward layers
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="inputQ">The input Q tensor</param>
        /// <param name="inputK">The input K tensor</param>
        /// <param name="inputV">The input V tensor</param>
        /// <param name="keyMask">The mask for softmax</param>
        /// <param name="batchSize">Batch size of input data set</param>
        /// <param name="graph">The instance of computing graph</param>
        /// <returns>Transformered output tensor</returns>
        public (IWeightTensor, IWeightTensor) Perform(IWeightTensor inputQ, IWeightTensor inputK, IWeightTensor inputV, IWeightTensor keyMask, int batchSize, IComputeGraph graph, bool outputAttenWeights = false)
        {
            using IComputeGraph g = graph.CreateSubGraph($"{m_name}_MultiHeadAttention");
            int seqLenQ = inputQ.Rows / batchSize;

            // SeqLenK must be euqal to SeqLenV
            int seqLenK = inputK.Rows / batchSize;
            int seqLenV = inputV.Rows / batchSize;

            IWeightTensor inputQNorm = layerNormQ.Norm(inputQ, g);

            //Input projections
            IWeightTensor allQ = g.View(g.Affine(inputQNorm, Q, Qb), dims: new long[] { batchSize, seqLenQ, m_multiHeadNum, m_d });
            IWeightTensor allK = g.View(g.Affine(inputK, K, Kb), dims: new long[] { batchSize, seqLenK, m_multiHeadNum, m_d });
            IWeightTensor allV = g.View(g.Affine(inputV, V, Vb), dims: new long[] { batchSize, seqLenV, m_multiHeadNum, m_d });

            //Multi-head attentions
            IWeightTensor Qs = g.View(g.AsContiguous(g.Transpose(allQ, 1, 2)), dims: new long[] { batchSize * m_multiHeadNum, seqLenQ, m_d });
            IWeightTensor Ks = g.View(g.AsContiguous(g.Transpose(g.Transpose(allK, 1, 2), 2, 3)), dims: new long[] { batchSize * m_multiHeadNum, m_d, seqLenK });
            IWeightTensor Vs = g.View(g.AsContiguous(g.Transpose(allV, 1, 2)), dims: new long[] { batchSize * m_multiHeadNum, seqLenV, m_d });

            // Scaled softmax
            float scale = 1.0f / (float)(Math.Sqrt(m_d));
            var attn = g.MulBatch(Qs, Ks, scale);
            attn = g.View(attn, dims: new long[] { batchSize, m_multiHeadNum, seqLenQ, seqLenK });

            if (keyMask != null)
            {
                attn = g.Add(attn, keyMask, runGradient1: true, runGradient2: false, inPlace: true);
            }

            var attnProbs = g.Softmax(attn, inPlace: true);

            IWeightTensor sumAttnWeights = null;
            if (outputAttenWeights)
            {
                //Merge all attention probs over multi-heads
                sumAttnWeights = g.Sum(attnProbs, 1, runGradient: false);
                sumAttnWeights = graph.Mul(sumAttnWeights, 1.0f / (float)m_multiHeadNum, runGradient: false);
                sumAttnWeights = graph.View(sumAttnWeights, false, new long[] { batchSize * seqLenQ, seqLenK });
            }

            attnProbs = g.View(attnProbs, dims: new long[] { batchSize * m_multiHeadNum, seqLenQ, seqLenK });

            IWeightTensor o = g.View(g.MulBatch(attnProbs, Vs), dims: new long[] { batchSize, m_multiHeadNum, seqLenQ, m_d });
            IWeightTensor W = g.View(g.AsContiguous(g.Transpose(o, 1, 2)), dims: new long[] { batchSize * seqLenQ, m_multiHeadNum * m_d });

            // Output projection
            IWeightTensor finalAttResults = g.Dropout(g.Affine(W, W0, b0), batchSize, m_dropoutRatio, inPlace: true);
            IWeightTensor result = graph.Add(finalAttResults, inputQ, inPlace: true);


            return (result, sumAttnWeights);
        }
```
# Build Your Operations  
Seq2SeqSharp includes many built-in operations for neural networks. You can visit IComputeGraph.cs to get interfaces and ComputeGraphTensor.cs to get implementation.  
You can also implement your customized operations. Here is an example for "w1 * w2 + w3 * w4" in a single operation. The forward part includes 1) create result tensor and 2) call inner-operation "Ops.MulMulAdd".  
And the backward part is in "backward" action that the gradients of each input tensor(w?) will be added by the product between weights of input tensor(w?) and gradients of the output tensor(res).  
If the operations is for forward part only, you can completely ignore "backward" action.  

```c#
        public IWeightTensor EltMulMulAdd(IWeightTensor w1, IWeightTensor w2, IWeightTensor w3, IWeightTensor w4)
        {
            var m1 = w1 as WeightTensor;
            var m2 = w2 as WeightTensor;
            var m3 = w3 as WeightTensor;
            var m4 = w4 as WeightTensor;

            var res = m_weightTensorFactory.CreateWeightTensor(m1.Sizes, m_deviceId, name: $"{GetHashString(w1.Name, w2.Name, w3.Name, w4.Name)}.EltMulMulAdd");
            VisualizeNodes(new IWeightTensor[] { w1, w2, w3, w4 }, res);

            Ops.MulMulAdd(res.TWeight, m1.TWeight, m2.TWeight, m3.TWeight, m4.TWeight);
            if (m_needsBackprop)
            {
                Action backward = () =>
                {
                    res.ReleaseWeight();

                    m1.AddMulGradient(m2.TWeight, res.TGradient);
                    m2.AddMulGradient(m1.TWeight, res.TGradient);

                    m3.AddMulGradient(m4.TWeight, res.TGradient);
                    m4.AddMulGradient(m3.TWeight, res.TGradient);

                    res.Dispose();
                };
                this.m_backprop.Add(backward);
            }

            return res;
        }
```

# Build Your Networks  
Besides operations and layers, you can also build your customized networks by leveraging BaseSeq2SeqFramework. The built-in AttentionSeq2Seq is a good example to show you how to do it. Basically, it includes the follows steps:  
1. Define model meta data, such as hidden layer dimension, embedding diemnsion, layer depth and so on. It should be inherited from IModelMetaData interface. You can look at Seq2SeqModelMetaData.cs as an example.  
```c#
 public class Seq2SeqModelMetaData : IModelMetaData
 {
        public int HiddenDim;
        public int EmbeddingDim;
        public int EncoderLayerDepth;
        public int DecoderLayerDepth;
        public int MultiHeadNum;
        public EncoderTypeEnums EncoderType;
        public Vocab Vocab;
 }
```
2. Create the class for your network and make sure it is inherited from BaseSeq2SeqFramework class at first, and then define layers, tensors for your network. Seq2SeqSharp has some built-in layers, so you can just use them or create your customized layers by instruction in above. In order to support multi-GPUs, these layers and tensors should be wrapped by MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper class. Here is an example:  
```c#
        private MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IWeightTensor> m_srcEmbedding; //The embeddings over devices for target
        private MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IWeightTensor> m_tgtEmbedding; //The embeddings over devices for source
        private MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IEncoder> m_encoder; //The encoders over devices. It can be LSTM, BiLSTM or Transformer
        private MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<AttentionDecoder> m_decoder; //The LSTM decoders over devices        
        private MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<FeedForwardLayer> m_decoderFFLayer; //The feed forward layers over devices after LSTM layers in decoder
```
3. Initialize those layers and tensors your defined in above. You should pass variables you defined in model meta data to the constructors of layers and tensors. Here is an example in AttentionSeq2Seq.cs  
```c#
        private bool CreateTrainableParameters(IModelMetaData mmd)
        {
            Logger.WriteLine($"Creating encoders and decoders...");
            Seq2SeqModelMetaData modelMetaData = mmd as Seq2SeqModelMetaData;
            RoundArray<int> raDeviceIds = new RoundArray<int>(DeviceIds);

            if (modelMetaData.EncoderType == EncoderTypeEnums.BiLSTM)
            {
                m_encoder = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IEncoder>(
                    new BiEncoder("BiLSTMEncoder", modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim, modelMetaData.EncoderLayerDepth, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem()), DeviceIds);
                m_decoder = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<AttentionDecoder>(
                    new AttentionDecoder("AttnLSTMDecoder", modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim, modelMetaData.HiddenDim * 2, modelMetaData.DecoderLayerDepth, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem()), DeviceIds);
            }
            else
            {
                m_encoder = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IEncoder>(
                    new TransformerEncoder("TransformerEncoder", modelMetaData.MultiHeadNum, modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim, modelMetaData.EncoderLayerDepth, m_dropoutRatio, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem()), DeviceIds);
                m_decoder = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<AttentionDecoder>(
                    new AttentionDecoder("AttnLSTMDecoder", modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim, modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.DecoderLayerDepth, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem()), DeviceIds);
            }
            m_srcEmbedding = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IWeightTensor>(new WeightTensor(new long[2] { modelMetaData.Vocab.SourceWordSize, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim }, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem(), normal: true, name: "SrcEmbeddings", isTrainable: true), DeviceIds);
            m_tgtEmbedding = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<IWeightTensor>(new WeightTensor(new long[2] { modelMetaData.Vocab.TargetWordSize, modelMetaData.EmbeddingDim }, raDeviceIds.GetNextItem(), normal: true, name: "TgtEmbeddings", isTrainable: true), DeviceIds);
            m_decoderFFLayer = new MultiProcessorNetworkWrapper<FeedForwardLayer>(new FeedForwardLayer("FeedForward", modelMetaData.HiddenDim, modelMetaData.Vocab.TargetWordSize, dropoutRatio: 0.0f, deviceId: raDeviceIds.GetNextItem()), DeviceIds);

            return true;
        }
```
4. Implement forward part only for your network and the BaseSeq2SeqFramework will handle all other things, such as backward propagation, parameters updates, memory management, computing graph managment, corpus shuffle & batching, saving/loading for model, logging & monitoring, checkpoints and so on. Here is an example in AttentionSeq2Seq.cs as well.  
```c#
        /// <summary>
        /// Run forward part on given single device
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="computeGraph">The computing graph for current device. It gets created and passed by the framework</param>
        /// <param name="srcSnts">A batch of input tokenized sentences in source side</param>
        /// <param name="tgtSnts">A batch of output tokenized sentences in target side</param>
        /// <param name="deviceIdIdx">The index of current device</param>
        /// <returns>The cost of forward part</returns>
        private float RunForwardOnSingleDevice(IComputeGraph computeGraph, List<List<string>> srcSnts, List<List<string>> tgtSnts, int deviceIdIdx)
        {   
            (IEncoder encoder, AttentionDecoder decoder, IWeightTensor srcEmbedding, IWeightTensor tgtEmbedding, FeedForwardLayer decoderFFLayer) = GetNetworksOnDeviceAt(deviceIdIdx);

            // Reset networks
            encoder.Reset(computeGraph.GetWeightFactory(), srcSnts.Count);
            decoder.Reset(computeGraph.GetWeightFactory(), tgtSnts.Count);

Now you already have your customized network and you can play it. See Progream.cs in Seq2SeqConsole project about how to load corpus and vocabulary, and create network for training.  

# How To Play Your Network  
In Seq2SeqConsole project, it shows you how to initialize and train your network. Here are few steps about how to do it.  
```c#
                    Seq2SeqCorpus trainCorpus = new Seq2SeqCorpus(corpusFilePath: opts.TrainCorpusPath, srcLangName: opts.SrcLang, tgtLangName: opts.TgtLang, batchSize: opts.BatchSize, shuffleBlockSize: opts.ShuffleBlockSize,
                        maxSrcSentLength: opts.MaxSrcTrainSentLength, maxTgtSentLength: opts.MaxTgtTrainSentLength, shuffleEnums: shuffleType);
                    // Load valid corpus
                    Seq2SeqCorpus validCorpus = string.IsNullOrEmpty(opts.ValidCorpusPath) ? null : new Seq2SeqCorpus(opts.ValidCorpusPath, opts.SrcLang, opts.TgtLang, opts.ValBatchSize, opts.ShuffleBlockSize, opts.MaxSrcTestSentLength, opts.MaxTgtTestSentLength, shuffleEnums: shuffleType);

                    // Create learning rate
                    ILearningRate learningRate = new DecayLearningRate(opts.StartLearningRate, opts.WarmUpSteps, opts.WeightsUpdateCount);

                    // Create optimizer
                    IOptimizer optimizer = null;
                    if (String.Equals(opts.Optimizer, "Adam", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))
                    {
                        optimizer = new AdamOptimizer(opts.GradClip, opts.Beta1, opts.Beta2);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        optimizer = new RMSPropOptimizer(opts.GradClip, opts.Beta1);
                    }

                    // Create metrics
                    List<IMetric> metrics = new List<IMetric>
                    {
                        new BleuMetric(),
                        new LengthRatioMetric()
                    };

                    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(opts.ModelFilePath) && File.Exists(opts.ModelFilePath))
                    {
                        //Incremental training
                        Logger.WriteLine($"Loading model from '{opts.ModelFilePath}'...");
                        ss = new Seq2Seq(opts);
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        // Load or build vocabulary

                            Logger.WriteLine($"Loading source vocabulary from '{opts.SrcVocab}' and target vocabulary from '{opts.TgtVocab}'. Shared vocabulary is '{opts.SharedEmbeddings}'");
                            if (opts.SharedEmbeddings == true && (opts.SrcVocab != opts.TgtVocab))
                            {
                                throw new ArgumentException("The source and target vocabularies must be identical if their embeddings are shared.");
                            }

                            // Vocabulary files are specified, so we load them
                            srcVocab = new Vocab(opts.SrcVocab);
                            tgtVocab = new Vocab(opts.TgtVocab);
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            Logger.WriteLine($"Building vocabulary from training corpus. Shared vocabulary is '{opts.SharedEmbeddings}'");
                            // We don't specify vocabulary, so we build it from train corpus

                            (srcVocab, tgtVocab) = trainCorpus.BuildVocabs(opts.VocabSize, opts.SharedEmbeddings);
                        }

                        //New training
                        ss = new Seq2Seq(opts, srcVocab, tgtVocab);
                    }

                    // Add event handler for monitoring
                    ss.StatusUpdateWatcher += ss_StatusUpdateWatcher;
                    ss.EvaluationWatcher += ss_EvaluationWatcher;

                    // Kick off training
                    ss.Train(maxTrainingEpoch: opts.MaxEpochNum, trainCorpus: trainCorpus, validCorpus: validCorpus, learningRate: learningRate, optimizer: optimizer, metrics: metrics);
